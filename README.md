# Unexpected Arguments Object Behavior in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet important JavaScript bug related to the `arguments` object within functions. The `arguments` object, while appearing array-like, lacks standard array methods and has some unexpected behaviors.  This example highlights these limitations and shows how to mitigate them.

## Bug Description
The `arguments` object isn't a true array, leading to issues when expecting standard array methods or array-like behavior.  Common mistakes involve using methods like `map`, `filter`, or `forEach`, which are not directly available on `arguments`.

## Solution
The recommended solution is to convert the `arguments` object into a true array using `Array.from()` or the spread syntax (`...`). This ensures that you can then utilize all standard array methods seamlessly.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.js` to see the unexpected behavior.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version utilizing `Array.from()`.
